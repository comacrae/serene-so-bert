Python is my first language and for my first project I want to make a program that will grab my active windows names and how long i've been in there (pretty much an automatic time tracker) but I have no idea where to start in the code. Is it just that I need to google and look at other projects like mine or is it something else?@TheRevTastic Do you know how to do that manually",
