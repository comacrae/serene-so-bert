If I run Quart in development mode Quart works fine but when I just Hypercorn(production) it just doesn't work due to asyncio stuff. Well I implemented a fix https://paste.pythondiscord.com/puvunehavi.py but it partially works. None of the commands/events work but I can use the client object and make the bot do stuff. Any ideas on how I can fix this?",
