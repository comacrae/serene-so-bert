It doesn't include the memory occupied by the object's dependent objects (i.e. its attributes and their dependent objects). So here```pyclass A: def __init__(self numbers): self.numbers = numbersa = A([1 2 3 ... 1000])```when you do `sys.getsizeof(a)` you get `48` i.e. it doesn't include the memory occupied by the list. ```pyclass A: def __init__(self numbers): self.numbers = numbersnumbers = [1 2 3 ... 1000]a = A(numbers)b = A(numbers)```^ well how much memory is occupied by `a` and how much memory is occupied by `b`? Is it 48 for each of them or is it (48 + size of `numbers`) for each of them? Also see: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33978/findouthowmuchmemoryisbeingusedbyanobjectinpython>",
