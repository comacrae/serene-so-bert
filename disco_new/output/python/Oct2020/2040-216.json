A byte string is a sequence of unsurprisingly bytes  things that can be stored on disk. The mapping between them is an encoding  there are quite a lot of these (and infinitely many are possible)  and you need to know which applies in the particular case in order to do the conversion since a different encoding may map the same bytes to a different string:`",
