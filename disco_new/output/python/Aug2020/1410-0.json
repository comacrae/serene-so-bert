But when I do it multiple times and float points increase  I get the e05 and my results start to mess up my script. Can anyone give me a quick lesson on this? If possible I need to fix the float length to 8 decimals and possibly round down. Suggestions?(Yes I tried stackoverflow  but I simply do not understand the answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22756324/howtoavoide05inpython)",
