Problem is I cant carry my desktop along (of course) so I carried along a laptop I use for presentations and such. now the laptop isnt bad but its not gaming material 4gb ram etc.. I have an android smartphone with 8GB RAM so I\\'m wondering if its possible to somehow do some distributed computing thing where the PC uses the Phone\\'s inbuilt RAM. when I googled it most people were like just dont do it but can I get a better answer? Because I remember I saw someone build a PC with multiple RasPis so it seems like it should be possible",
