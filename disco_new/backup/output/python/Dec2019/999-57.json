I\\'ve been trying to use PyInstaller to port my app over but its fine for me to just run the app however using PyInstaller highlighted a potential reason for the bug I experience when running my app. ```Unable to find /Users/Jason/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/sitepackages/PyQt5/Qt/lib/QtWebEngineCore.framework/Resources when adding binary and data files.``` QtWebEngineView isn\\'t working and this might be the reason. But I have no idea where to get this .framework file. It works fine on Windows but not on Mac. On Mac i used pip install PyQt5. Is there a better way? Or some way to get that .framework file installed without messing with anything else?",
