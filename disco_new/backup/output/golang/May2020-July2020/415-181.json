        "text": "so i have a benchmark that I run in CI which for whatever reason i can't understand takes like 30 minutes sometimes other times it just times out. When I run the benchmark locally it takes like 300s or some shit. I've isolated the benchmark which takes ages to complete to the following one written as pseudocode that uploads a file and downloads it. I ensure that during data generation and upload not to have the timer running because im not interested in measuring that in this benchmark as it is covered by another one:```b.ResetTimer()for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ { rand.Read(10MB buffer) doFileUpload() b.StartTimer() doFileDownload() b.StopTimer()```is there some better way to do this?",
